http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57525844/honduran-court-private-cities-unconstitutional/  
Plato, in a previous episode you talked about free cities in Honduras, but the supreme court ruled them unconstitutional.

http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/11/student-suspension/?utm_source=feedburner
Smuggler, when Andrea Hernandez raised the issue of administrators RFID tagging
her high school classmates, we advised the students to find fun and creative
hacks. Instead, Andrea got suspended for refusing to wear it. What do you have
to say to the rest of the students at John Jay High School?

Voodoo, you have said dogs are just dowsing rods for probable cause. UC Santa Barbara researchers have made a mechanical explosives detector that in some cases is better than a dog. Doesn't that sound better to you?

http://reason.com/blog/2012/10/31/post-sandy-price-gouging-by-uber-econ-10  
Wise-guy, we talked about rideshare startups Lyft and Sidecar. Did you hear that Uber was accused of price gouging after hurricane Sandy?

http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-18/news/33931869_1_nypd-drones-bus-shelters  
http://www.pressherald.com/news/maine-artist-faces-charges-in-new-york_2012-12-04.html  
Smuggler, in September, Essam Attia placed posters depicting the NYPD shooting at kids from drones at bus stops. The NYPD apparently didn't want the conversation. In November, they charged Essam with 56 counts of possession of a forged instrument and possessing an unloaded .22 calibre rifle. Why are they so afraid of a conversation?

http://reason.com/blog/2012/09/28/a-third-of-americans-worry-about-police  
Plato, according to an AP poll, only 36% of Americans are opposed to police use of unmanned drones. Why is this number so low?

http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2012/11/25/obama-administration-was-not-willing-to-trust-romney-with-a-secret-kill-list/  
Voodoo, after the US election it came out that Obama didn't trust Romney with the "kill list". Why doesn't Obama trust democracy?

Econ & Finance
------

http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/78-percent-of-bitcoin-currency-stashed-under-digital-mattress-study-finds/  
Plato, a study found that 78% of bitcoins remained under the control of the persons who mined them. What will happend to the bitcoin economy when those bitcoins are unleashed?

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/07/could-two-platinum-coins-solve-the-debt-ceiling-crisis/?hpid=z2  
Voodoo, among the stupid ideas for not falling off or cushioning the fiscal cliff is a proposal to mint trillion dollar platinum coins. If you are going to fish in your couch for loose change, it might as well be worth your while, right?

http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/10/17/large-cash-transactions-banned-in-mexico/  
Wise-guy, Mexico has banned large cash transactions. Have similar cash bans produced results, or is this just a continuation of the war on anonymity?

Evil People Being Evil

http://www.wired.com/business/2012/10/google-gets-closer-to-a-court-date/  
Smuggler, the FTC is reportedly close to a settlement with Google over what they call anti trust violations. Do you prominently display your competitor's advice on shadowlife.cc?

http://torrentfreak.com/six-strikes-anti-piracy-plan-delayed-till-121128/  
Plato, ISPs in the US are set to enforce the so-called six strikes rule in 2013. What advice can you give people who want to keep Internet access?

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/us-seeks-computer-geeks-to-guard-against-digital-attacks/article4797234/  
Voodoo, the Dept. of Homeland Security wants to set up a reserve of weekend keyboard warriors to be called up in case of cyber emergency. Have you filled out your cyber draft card?

http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/11/crypto-keys-stolen-from-virtual-machine/  
Smuggler, researchers have published a paper detailing a side-channel attack to recover a private key from a virtual machine. Given that all enterprises of any size are or have moved to virtualization, how concerned should businesses be about this attack?

http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57558038-71/futuristic-handcuffs-would-administer-shocks-drugs  
Plato, Scottsdale Inventions has patented handcuffs that can deliver shocks or administer drugs by remote control. Besides the obvious BDSM implications, how excited are cops about these?

http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/14/china-tightens-great-firewall-internet-control  
Voodoo, Chinese ISPs are using DPI to learn, discover, and block VPN access from within China. How easy would it be to implement a scheme like this in North America or Europe?

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9757895/Jobless-to-be-remotely-monitored-by-Government.html  
Wise-guy, the UK has begun monitoring the online habits of jobless persons. Participation in the program are mandatory, but the sanctions for noncompliance are mandatory. What are some alternatives to a program like this?

Tech News
--------

http://securityledger.com/new-25-gpu-monster-devours-passwords-in-seconds/  
Smuggler, Jeremy Gosney was able to build a rig with 25 GPUs and churn through 348 billion password hashes a second. What should this tell anyone about password managment?

http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Tonnes+iron+dumped+coast/7395723/story.html  
Wise-guy, Russ George dumped 100 tons of iron sulfate in the Pacific Ocean to produce a plankton bloom and lock carbon to the bottom of the ocean. Is this the eco-terrorism we've been told to expect?

http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/11/zeta-radio/  
Plato, Danger Room has linked the dissappearance of 36 communications technicians to the Zetas cartel building a radio network in Northern Mexico. How is the cartel making an uneconomic arrangement like slavery work?

http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/11/google-wallet-may-integrate-programmable-payment-cards  
Smuggler, it appears that Google will be introducing a physical payment card to supplement their Google Wallet app. How secure will this arrangement be?
