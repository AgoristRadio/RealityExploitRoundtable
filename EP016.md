[Coder Charged for Gambling Software](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/coder-charged-for-gambling-software/)

Wired reports:
> a software maker who licenses a program used by online casinos and bookmakers
> overseas is being charged with promoting gambling in New York because
> authorities say his software was used by others for illegal betting in that
> state.

> New York authorities say that about $2.3 million that Robert Stuart and his
> company, Extension Software, received in cash and money orders for licensing his
> software constitutes direct proceeds of illegal, U.S.-based bookmaking
> operations.

Stuart isn't operating a gambling web site. He and his company simply used their
brains to put a bunch of numbers in a specific order. Now that's apparently a
criminal act. 

The New York DA says:

> “These defendants abetted large-scale illegal gambling in the U.S. and abroad.
> In doing so, they gave bettors an easy way to place illegal wagers, and created
> an appetite for further unlawful activity.”

The DA's argument seems to be that Extension Software helped criminals commit
crimes and must be punished. I won't even touch the hypocrisy here but I will
mention a recent Glen Greenwald article. He points out that the USG accuses
Bradley Manning of 'communicating with the enemy,' a capital crime. Yet
journalist Bob Woodward leaked top secret information - higher secrecy than
Manning's classified information - and doesn't get in trouble.

So it's the same old story with this programmer. He's going against the will of
the State and thus will be punished.

Wise-Guy, do you have advice for coders working on sensitive projects that
threaten or subvert the state?

TOPIC 2 - Smuggler

Future Smuggling Markets

Smuggler this question obviously has to go to you. Via WaPo, [a study done by
Wikistrat](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/26/the-future-of-smuggling-drones-coal-and-honeybees/)
offers some ideas of goods that may be smuggled in the future. Some of those
include honeybees, coal, cigarettes, water, and privacy technology.

First, is there a story behind the name Smuggler? Second, how does a budding
entrepreneur decide what goods to smuggle?

[http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/secrets-and-lies-of-the-bailout-one-brokers-story-20130108](Secrets
and Lies of the Bailout: One Broker's Story)

Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi has just released an article titled 'Secrets and
Lies of the Bailout' that summarizes the 2008 bank bailouts and what's happened
with Wall Street since then. It's long and detailed but the gist of it seems to
be that the State-financial complex has worked really hard to build up the
reputation of Wall Street with bailouts and promises, even though they're still
behaving as irresponsibly as they were five years ago.

Voodoo, you wanna take it from here? Maybe explain what the hell happened in
2008 and why Taibbi's never had anything positive to say about Wall Street?
