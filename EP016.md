Future Smuggling Markets

Smuggler this question obviously has to go to you. Via WaPo, [a study done by
Wikistrat](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/26/the-future-of-smuggling-drones-coal-and-honeybees/)
offers some ideas of goods that may be smuggled in the future. Some of those
include honeybees, coal, cigarettes, water, and privacy technology.

First, is there a story behind the name Smuggler? Second, how does a budding
entrepreneur decide what goods to smuggle?
