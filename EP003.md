##  Plato: Agorist Insurance: SMART - the Sovereign Mutual Aid Response Team and Shield Mutual Agorist Insurance

### Intro:

In Mid 2011 Jim Davidson of Individual Sovereign University announced
"SMART: the Sovereign Mutual Aid Response Team". At that time and
since he has posted updates and put up a site for joining. Mid
2012, George Donnely of Agora.io fame, announces another similar
company called "Shield Mutual Agorist Insurance".

These are both companies offering many overlapping services such as
helping you if you are arrested, bond money, youtube/social network
publicity. Legal defense and offense. A contact/ping like service to
check up on you regularly.  Helping you deal with aggressive and
unjust law enforcement officials.

In some ways this reminds me of a Mutual Aid Society mix with the
ACLU, the EFF and an Insurance Company with a business model all from
an agorist frame.

Plato: Is there a market for this? Is the business model for this
sustainable? What do you find interesting about these services and
what do you think the future may hold for them?

What is SMART?

 "SMART (AKA University Association) is a BRAND NEW member supported
 subscription based service with the goal of defending your life,
 liberty, and property from external invasion. Activists from across
 the county are building networks and communities of safety that can
 spring in to action at a moments notice, ready and willing to stand
 up for you. When activated SMART will muster support, raise bail
 money and get you out of jail, and assist you in finding legal help
 should you need it. SMART is also equipped to help you deal with nosy
 and intrusive bureaucrats and aggressive and unjust law enforcement
 officials.

- [Lodge Practice Medical Assistance](http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2011/tle636-20110911-06.html)
  "In U.S. history, many lodges and other fraternal groups hired a
  doctor for a fixed fee per mont h. When someone in the group became
  ill or was injured, the group's doctor attended to him at no
  additional charge. This system was known as "lodge practice" and was
  in widespread use. After the AMA was formed and became aggressive in
  the early twentieth century in taking measures to raise the earnings
  of doctors, the association fought tooth and nail against lodge
  practice and eventually killed it."

- [Shield Mutual Agorist Insurance](http://georgedonnelly.com/agorism/shield-mutual-agorist-insurance)

- George: "When I first founded Shield Mutual last year, the concept
  was more mutualistic in nature. But almost no one signed up. So I
  decided to tweak the concept into a pay service where I was
  personally responsible for providing a service. Lo and behold, this
  works better."

- Shield Mutual coverage is just $50 FRNs or 7.6 bitcoins per year

## Wise Guy: Super Cheap Nano Solar Panels?

### Intro:

From the Wired article titled: "Nano Breakthrough Paves Way for Super
Cheap Solar Panels":

  "One of the reasons solar panels are so expensive is that it’s
  tricky to extract electric currents from semiconductors, the
  materials used to convert solar radiation into electrical energy.

  Up til now, this could only be done with a few materials — usually
  silicon. But a new breakthrough will enable manufacturers to make
  efficient photovoltaics using almost any semiconductor, including
  cheap and abundant materials like metal oxides, sulfides, and
  phosphides."


Keypoints: 

- Most Solar biz companies are based on getting rich with gov grants,
  gov direct subsidies and gov subsidised purchases.

- Nanosolar Corp with their thin film printing has burned through 450M
  USD over the past few years. Where is the beef in low production
  costs and legit sales?

- Are any of these nano solar techs something we as inidividuals will
  be able to purchase and use with prices driven: by  markets and not
  corporatist/socialized driven government welfare?

- Is there anything to this tech that is breakthrough in cost in spite
  of patent monopolies on top of it all?

## Smuggler: - [Failbook abstainers suspicious](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/07/29/1627203/facebook-abstainers-could-be-labeled-suspicious)

Intro:

  Posted on slashdot by bs0d3: "According to an article printed in
  tagesspiegel.de, not having a Facebook account could be the first
  sign that you are a mass murderer.(German) As examples they use
  Norwegian shooter Anders Breivik, who used MySpace instead of
  Facebook and the newer Aurora shooter who used adultfriendfinder
  instead of Facebook. They already consider those with Facebook
  accounts, who lack friends to be suspicious, but now they are
  suggesting that anyone who abstains from Facebook altogether may be
  even more suspicious."

Smuggler: I would assume that most national government databases are
already associating the citizen registry with internal or externally
linked databases of social network accounts and relationship graphs.
_It would make sense to me that they would start flagging people whom
are not so apparent on their radar. Is there a an equalibrium in
tradecraft that might be a best practice so as not to stand out or be
flagged and targetted... while attempting to just maintain personal
privacy?

## Voodoo: - Banana Republics Gone Wild

- Queue Intro clip: [Nationalize US Oil, Thom Hartman, RT](http://www.mediafire.com/?b236dfkfa9cn5fk)

Key points: 
- Bolivia is kicking Coca Cola out of the country.
- Argentina gov is nationalizing a Spain based Oil company

Voodoo: Thom Harman seems to on the class war bandwagon, while South
America sounds like something out of Atlas Shrugged. Is this the end
of Big Capitalism in South America? 

Won't the CIA also overthrow its own government if Big Oil
nationalization attempt was made?

and on CocaCola... personally... I say fuck CocaCola as I am no fanboy
of modern Ayn Rand/Cato Institute Mega Corporations.

Kicking Coca Cola out of the country will first get rid of 90% of the
CIA Field Agents - just Google: Coca Cola CIA,  second Coca Cola and
friends get [a $4B USD Federal Subsidy through SNAP food stamps](http://www.minyanville.com/special-features/articles/soda-tax-coca-cola-coke-pepsi/8/5/2010/id/29349), 

Thirdly Coca Cola gets its domestic Corn Syrup at government
subsidised rates saving billions per year. Lastly Coca Cola financed
the US government in 2011 with: $2.4 billion in Taxes, this does not count
employee taxes that went toward domestic and foreign Statist coffers.

Why should we give a damn about Coca Cola or Big Oil Nationalizations?
What are the more interesting aspects of this story or insights to
larger underlying problems besides right-wing cries of
"Banana Republic Nationalization!"?
