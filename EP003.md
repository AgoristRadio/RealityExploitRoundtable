We have been negative on Argentina for some time as South America's
second-largest country has struggled with hyperinflation and extreme
political risk. GDP grew by 8.9% in 2011, but inflation probably
topped estimates of 24% following several years of hyperinflation.
Economic figures coming out of Argentina are suspect, as the
government denies estimates for inflation, reporting a rise of just 9%
last year. Economists expect growth to fall to just 2.75% this year.
