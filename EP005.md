Ernie, you're not one to worry about people knowing where you are and what you're up to. In fact, you make a point of calling your shots. John Q. Public doesn't do that, but has a demonstrated lack of care about his personal privacy. So why is this such a big story?

> Facebook seems to recognise that its current procedure to collect biometric data of its users conflicts with European and German data protection laws. This development is to be welcomed. Yet, Facebook is not entitled to stop their commitment halfway.

> It is regrettable that Facebook has not used the chance for a consensual solution but is obviously playing for time. However, we will now resume administrative proceedings. Facebook has detailed knowledge of our legal opinion.

Smuggler, what exactly is the threat to Facebook from the German data protection authority and their legal opinions?
