## Tips to Download YouTube Videos to convert to audio clips:

 * [Download Helper](http://downloadhelper.net) extension for firefox.
 * [BYTubeD](http://msram.github.com/bytubed/) extension for firefox. Good for batch downloading youtube playlists etc also.
 * Convert YouTube FLV to mp3:  
   **Audacity** import the flv, then export as mp3. Usually works pretty good.  
   **VLC** Open FLV with 'Stream/Save' menu option, select output mp3 and no local playback
