> It's governments and big businesses who control the databases; if someone compromises one, 
  that's like identity theft times a million. Smuggler, what else could go wrong with biometrics?
  
* Hiro: [Kim Dotcom's Pretrial Legal Funds Would Be Safe With Bitcoin - Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/07/12/kim-dotcoms-pretrial-legal-funds-would-be-safe-with-bitcoin/) | [Kim Dotcom Video - Mr President](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MokNvbiRqCM&feature=plcp) | [Kim Dotcom - The Interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvrRaeHD5TE&feature=plcp)  

> Bitcoin has the potential to be extremely disruptive but so far it's tame. Hiro, do you think that States 
  will start actively interfering once people start using Bitcoin to hide their funds from those States?

* Wise-Guy: http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/21/offshore-wealth-global-economy-tax-havens

> I for one don't think the system's broken, I think it was built this way on purpose. Seriously, haven't 
  we known for, like, forever that elites exploit offshore tax loopholes? Wise-guy, what's your take on this?

> I had an interesting discussion with a friend about the AK-47. He argued that its net benefit to humanity 
  outweighs its net cost. Before the AK-47, you had all these victimized groups that were fighting their 
  opressors with rifles and handguns. Then this mass produced gun comes along, cheap, reliable and deadly -
  just what the little guy needs to stand up to the big guy. It acts as a force equalizer. So on one hand you 
  have millions of people killed by AK-47's, but on the other hand there are an unknown number of people who 
  would be subjugated or dead if they hadn't had AK-47's to defend themselves.
  
> Voodoo, ya think tech like 3D printed guns and drones is going to be enough to keep today's oppressors from 
  killing tomorrow's victims?
