> On 15 October, the Dutch ministry of Justice and Security proposed powers for

> vulnerabilities for enforcement purposes.

First off, governments hack people all the time already and they will likely
continue to do so whether it's legal or not. If they do legalize it, the Dutch
cybersecurity agencies will probably expand their hacking operations a bit.

So I guess right now cyber warfare is covert. And laws like this raise the
possibility of cyber warfare becoming overt. 

Wise-guy, can you offer a forecast of the future of cyber warfare?

3D Printer DRM scheme

So the idea here is that your printer will refuse to print stuff unless
you purchase the rights to the object from wheover owns the copyright. Probably
Disney or Viacom.

Obviously, one could still build a printer without the DRM chip. So, it seems
plausible to me that governments might outlaw non-DRM printers.

Voodoo, these 3D printers can print out a large portion of their own parts. Is
this a losing battle or what?

UN wants to take over the Internet
http://www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Pages/overview.aspx
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/congress-declares-opposition-to-un-takeover-of-the-internet/

The UN's communication committee - the ITU or International Telecommunication
Union - is currently meeting to modernize the International Telecommunication
Regulations. God that phrase makes me die a little inside. The regulations are
intended to 

> facilitate international interconnection and interoperability of information
> and communication services.

> The treaty sets out general principles for assuring the free flow of
> information around the world, promoting affordable and equitable access for
> all and laying the foundation for ongoing innovation and market growth.

There's widespread concern that the UN committee will agree to increase
government control of the Internet, limiting the free flow of inforation and
making it easier for states to spy upon and censor their internet traffic.

I was surprised to see that the US house of representatives unanimously voted to
oppose these UN regulations. 

Smuggler, are you concerned about this committee?

Iranian and Grecian Black Markets
http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-29/dollar-less-iranians-discover-virtual-currency
http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/10/greece%E2%80%99s-shadow-economy

Pundits say that Greeks got themselves into this mess by trading on the black
market instead of properly paying their taxes.

Friedrich Schneider, a professor at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz,
Austria, disagrees. He believes that up to half of Greece's shadow economy
complements activities in the official economy, adding to welfare and overall
GDP, and that stamping it out altogether might do more harm than good.

Leaving aside the difficulties of stamping out black markets, the money
circulating through the shadow economy will likely make it back to the legal
economy, at which point the Greek government can collect tax. 

Additionally, if the black market distributes resources more efficiently than
the white market, it means that participants in the black market can get more
stuff for less money. The individuals will prosper and in my humble opinion,
that's much more important than the state prospering.

A few countries away, Iranians are starting to discover Bitcoin. Users are using
directories of OTC exchangers to turn their rials into Bitcoins to bypass
sanctions and store wealth. Musician Mohammad Rafigh is one of the early
adopters, he's selling his tracks on coindl.

Hiro - These guys are abandoning the white market and moving to more profitable
paradigms. Do you have any tradecraft tips that will reduce their risks?
