## QE Bubbles about to burst


The efforts by developed and developing country central banks to avoid the politically and ideologically unwelcome "cure" of deflation by foolish policies of quantative easing are about to blow sky high. Deflation is actually the natural state of affairs. As a result of increased productivity, prices should drop over time, with more goods available at cheaper prices, to the benefit of everyone! But mainstream economists have no common sense about this and most clammor for a constant but managed inflation.

Deflation Fighting (Inflation Promotion) Does Five Things
    It increases government debt (as Japan found out)
    It promotes asset bubbles
    It delays the inevitable bust, making matters worse in the mean time
    It creates moral hazards
    It is a major factor in rising income inequality
