# The Soviet Surveillance States of America

Some text.

> For students of U.S. intelligence and law, the new confirmation that the federal government has been collecting phone call detail records
en masse on Americans shouldn't come as a big surprise. How did we get here and were are we going?

## Per-Jurisdiction Privacy

While the US Federal Govt grasps further communications, normal citizens also
have to obey the laws of state and local jurisdictions.

We are starting to see different rules being applied by different jurisdictions.
Piedmont, CA is using its residents' funds to install license plate readers at
15 points on the border of the municipality.

Meanwhile, the Texas legislature has passed a bill, HB 912, banning some private uses of drones.
Ars reports:

> The proposed law would make it a misdemeanor to have a drone photograph "an
> individual or privately owned real property... with the intent to conduct
> surveillance on the individual or property captured in the image." 

Of course, the authorities are still allowed to snoop about with their drones.

The Texas legislature also passed HB 2268, an email privacy bill that would require 
state authorities to get a warrent to access emails.

Both bills will become law if and when Texas governor Rick Perry decides to sign them.

And finally, citizens in Iowa City constructed a bill banning their local
government from using license plate readers, red light cameras and drones to
issue automated traffic and parking tickets. Instead an officer must physically
be on the scene and witness the event.

Plato, these jurisdictions have very different strategies when it comes to
privacy and technology. How do you think it will play out over the coming years?
