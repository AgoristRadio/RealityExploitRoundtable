RER Bonus Edition – What is Agorism?

Purpose
=======
To explain the concepts of Agorists, Counter-Economics, and Agorism and their roots in the Non-Aggression Principle. Additionally, to explain the differences between SEK3 agorism and Second Realm activities.

Background
==========
While there may be valid objections to agorism, many of the objections are rooted in a straw man version of agorism. The straw man version probably exists because it is difficult (or, at least, not common) to distill agorism into a coherent elevator speech. Unfortunately, many people who consider themselves agorists or are proponents of agorism lend credence to the straw man version and/or actively propagate it.

The straw man version of agorism is basically, “the purpose of agorism is to destroy the state by only doing business on the black market and not voting.”


Non-Aggression Principle
========================
- The non-aggression principle is the axiomatic statement that aggression is inherently illegitimate.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle

The non-aggression principle (also called the non-aggression axiom, the anti-coercion principle, the zero aggression principle, the non-initiation of force, ZAP, or NAP) is a moral stance which asserts that aggression is inherently illegitimate. Aggression, for the purposes of the NAP, is defined as the initiation or threatening of violence against a person or legitimately owned property of another. Specifically, any unsolicited actions of others that physically affect an individual’s property or person (which may also be considered that person's property), no matter if the result of those actions is damaging, beneficial, or neutral to the owner, are considered violent or aggressive when they are against the owner’s free will and interfere with his right to self-determination or the principle of self-ownership. Supporters of NAP often use it to demonstrate the immorality of theft, vandalism, assault, and fraud. In contrast to pacifism, the non-aggression principle does not preclude violence used in self-defense or defense of others.

-- NAP is an individual statement
--- “_I_ will not initiate force or fraud against persons or property.
--- No one can be forced to accept the NAP.

Agorists
========
- Agorists are individuals who structure their personal relationships, to the extent possible, to interact with other individuals who adhere to the NAP by word and deed.
-- In addition to the normal benefits of personal relationships, agorist relationships have an additional positive value – a mutual appreciation of the NAP
-- While not deterministic, someone who has a demonstrated history of non-aggression is more likely not to be an aggressor in the future.

Counter-Economics
=================
- Counter-Economics is a method of structuring contracts and business transactions to specifically exclude the state as a third party.
-- Reduce or eliminate dead weight loss or parasite drag due to the state.
-- Introduces a separate risk premium.
-- A transaction demonstrates that, ex ante, both parties judged the value of the transaction, including the parasite drag reduction and risk premium, to be beneficial.

Agorism
=======
- Agorism is a theory outlined by Samuel E. Konkin III in “The New Libertarian Manifesto” about a possible outcome of widespread adoption of counter-economic methods.
-- Agorism: the goal
-- Counter-Economics: the means
-- Revolution: the strategy
-- Action!: the tactics

Fallacies
=========
- Fallacy: Agorism is a strategy to smash the state.
- Fallacy: Agorists can be subjected to an agorist purity test.
- Fallacy: Agorism ideologically binds agorists to non-voting.
- Fallacy: Counter-Economics means doing business on the black market.
- Fallacy: Agorism is a subset/strategy for/practical application of anarcho-capitalism
- Fallacy: Counter-Economics is a tax-free flea market.
- Fallacy: Agorism is going “off-the-grid”.

The Second Realm
================
- Autonomy and Temporary Autonomous Zones
- Whereas the NAP is the individual granting liberty to all others, the Second Realm is the individual simultaneously grasping liberty for themselves
