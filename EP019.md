## Tools for the Coming Chaos

Joi Ito was interviewed in wired magazine recently, he is a diver,
entrepreneur, investor, author, occasional DJ, and head of MIT’s Media
Lab. wise-guy, I am going to ask you the same question Ito poses and ask
you to fill us in on some of what he shared and your thoughts on it.

Ito replies:

It appears they are using some tech called PhotoDNS that uses
biometric information in the photos with a database of 16K known
fingerprinted images.

Looks like they could use this same tech to detect movies and music if
they wanted to.

What do you think of this technology plato?

With new mini drones coming online I can forsee a future with this
even happening all over the US. Think truly "Anonymous Drone" strikes
not just by Feds, but by "Anonymous" type groups. No?

## Iran’s IT Ministry to Prosecute VPN Users

This is beyond censorship of a network connection. It appears to be
something like DMCA, where it is a crime to actually try and bypass
the censorship. Now the government is going to offer its own Legal
CleanIT type VPN Service. I was not aware that it actually was ILLEGAL
to even use Tor in Iran. What do you think about all of this Smuggler?
