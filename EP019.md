## Iran’s IT Ministry to Prosecute VPN Users

> “We are aware that many Internet users are utilizing VPNs to

This is beyond censorship of a network connection. It appears to be
something like DMCA, where it is a crime to actually try and bypass
the censorship.

Now the government is going to offer its own Legal CleanIT type VPN
Service. 

I was not aware that it actually was ILLEGAL to even use Tor in
Iran. What do you think about all of this Smuggler?

## Anonymous Sends In the Drones

> Russia Today reports on drone strikes in Pakistan that are being
> denied by the US Gov and Pakistan Gov. Fears are we are looking
> at a future of anonymous strikes around the globe with no one
> claiming, and no one being able to detect who did what.

With new mini drones coming online I can forsee a future with this
even happening all over the US. Think truly "Anonymous Drone" strikes
not just by Feds, but by "Anonymous" type groups.

# Topic 3 - wise-guy

## Tools for the Coming Chaos

Joi Ito was interviewed in wired magazine recently, he is a diver,
entrepreneur, investor, author, occasional DJ, and head of MIT’s Media
Lab

wise-guy, I am going to ask you the same question Ito poses and ask
you to fill us in on some of what he shared and your thoughts on it.

Ito replies:

> What you need to do is understand these changes are happening, and
> build systems and governments and ways of thinking that are
> resilient to this kind of destructive change that is going to
> happen. It’s a kind of change that is really hard to predict, it’s
> really hard to control, so how do you as a human being, or as an
> organization, survive in this chaotic, unpredictable system where
> planning is almost impossible?
