## Iran’s IT Ministry to Prosecute VPN Users

This is beyond censorship of a network connection. It appears to be
something like DMCA, where it is a crime to actually try and bypass
the censorship.

Now the government is going to offer its own Legal CleanIT type VPN
Service. 

I was not aware that it actually was ILLEGAL to even use Tor in
Iran. What do you think about all of this Smuggler?

## Anonymous Sends In the Drones

> Russia Today reports on drone strikes in Pakistan that are being
> denied by the US Gov and Pakistan Gov. Fears are we are looking
> at a future of anonymous strikes around the globe with no one
> claiming, and no one being able to detect who did what.

With new mini drones coming online I can forsee a future with this
even happening all over the US. Think truly "Anonymous Drone" strikes
not just by Feds, but by "Anonymous" type groups.
