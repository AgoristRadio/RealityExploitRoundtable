  Lead-in: It use to be said that freedom of the press belongs to those who own presses. The Internet has made everyone a publisher           
		and its revolutionizing journalism. Breakthroughs in manufacture through 3D printing may soon enable making                
		firearms without visiting a gun shop or being a machinist.

	Lead-in: In 2003 the DARPA-funded Total Information Awareness project	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office),
		a mass surveilence system, was defunded by Congress and its leader, former National Security Advisor, John Poindexter 		fired when it was acknowledged that members of Congress might, indirectly, be targets of the system. Now Microsoft  
		is helping New York City create an equally massive, citywide, surveilence system that could monitor anyone.     
		{Play Kelly excerp clip}
		smuggler, is it a paparazzi's wet dream? Will it reduce crime and eliminate terrorism in NYC? Will there be a backlash?

	Lead-in: Australian federal police and customs are beating their chests over the recent arrest of a man they say bought                
	illegal drugs using Bitcoin on the Tor-hosted Silk Road service. Did they trace Bitcoin payment, Was it a Silk Road

	Lead-in: It now widely assumed that all popular IM an voice chat services, many of which promoted privacy, are all open to             
	monitoring by the service and law enforcement. Skype, which for years indirectly maintained it could not eavesdrop, is            
	now being conspicuouly evasive.                                       
	VooDoo, if you're a curent Skype user or user of another service, and aren't pleased with their treatment of your              
	privacy what can you do?
