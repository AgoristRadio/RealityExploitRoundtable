### Iran: We're building our *own* internet. With blackjack! And hookers!

Washington Post reports that Iran is well on the way to creating an intranet -
an internal internet - and excluding the rest of the world. Quote:

>The researchers who uncovered the foundations of the new Iranian network said
>they found that it already hosted a number of Web sites — typically government
>or academic sites — meaning that the beginning of an Iranian Internet is
>already in operation.

Former Iranian parliment member Moussavi Khoeini says:

> “The main reason for this project is security ... They may say it’s to
> increase Internet speeds or protect against harmful content, but it’s always
> been security.”

Former deputy NSA director Cedric Leighton says that this project will improve
Iran's network security skills, increasing their capabilities to both launch and
repel cyberattacks. But he also says, quote,

>"Any attempt by a country to make an intranet is doomed to failure..."



If I've learned anything at all on the internet, it's that you can't control
data by fiat. Smuggler, you had a great line in Second Realm: Book On Strategy, 
paraphrasing: 'Data controls are to data what fences are to atoms.'

If Iran secedes from the internet and forces all its citizens to participate in
this intranet, what business models do you see evolving to subvert this? Data
blockade runners?
