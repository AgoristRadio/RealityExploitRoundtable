[Border Nazis Scan Debit Cards](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/11/07/department-of-homeland-security-to-scan-payment-cards-at-borders-and-airports/)

Jon Matonis writes:

Travelers leaving or entering the United States have long had to declare aggregated cash and other monetary instruments exceeding $10,000. Now, under a proposed amendment to the Bank Secrecy Act, FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) will also require travelers to declare the value of prepaid cards that they are carrying, known now as “tangible prepaid access devices.”

Expected to be finalized by the end of this year, the cross-border reporting modifications stem from a broader October 2011 definition of payment methods and form factors that replaced the term “stored value” with the term “prepaid access” in an effort to more accurately describe the process of accessing funds held by a payment provider.

Enforceability falls to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection both within the Department of Homeland Security, which is already developing advanced handheld card readers that can ascertain whether a traveler is carrying a credit card, debit card, or prepaid card. This differentiation is important because only prepaid card balances will need to be added to declaration report forms.

Wise-Guy: Assuming this system was in place and all cards were being scanned, how easy is it to get around these border nazis and avoid reporting your $10K of either the so called 'stored value' rules?

... Seems like this is just going to push more business into people just carrying bitcoin brainwallet codes with them, then meeting up with an exchanger on the other side of the border, and getting CASH for a code in hand.

... I wonder if they will scan ALL cards just to make sure a card that looks like a VISA CREDIT CARD is not just a fake plastic vanity card yet inside the strip an actual 'tangible prepaid card access device' as they call it.

Roll Warrant clip...

Voodoo, how is this possible that warrants can be issued for things unrelated to crimes, with probable cause? Also this shows that with all the complaints about Federal tyranny, local city tyranny is just as out of control.

['Creepy Cameraman' pushes limits of public surveillance](http://www.geekwire.com/2012/seattles-creepy-cameraman-pushes-limits-public-surveillance/)

Taboo: Roll audio clip

I recommend everyone check out these video clips. This guy is a complete dick doing what he did to these people in the videos, but there is educational value in seeing what his point was and how these people react to having a camera and mic pointed at them. They have cameras and mics on them everywhere, but if there is something personalized about it, like in someones hand, they freak out. The lesson I get from this is: 1) People really do care about their privacy when they are aware of being so blatantly recorded.  2) If you are going to go Big Brother on everyone, make sure the presentation of the devices is very mechanical and automated with no human face or presence associated with it.

Do you like the Creepy Cameraman Smuggler?

Next Camera Item:

[Police allowed to install cameras on private property without warrant](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/police-allowed-to-install-cameras-on-private-property-without-warrant/)

Arstechnica Writes:

A federal judge has ruled that police officers in Wisconsin did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they secretly installed cameras on private property without judicial approval.

The officers installed the cameras in an open field where they suspected the defendants, Manuel Mendoza and Marco Magana, were growing marijuana. The police eventually obtained a search warrant, but not until after some potentially incriminating images were captured by the cameras. The defendants have asked the judge to suppress all images collected prior to the issuance of the search warrant.

But in a Monday decision first reported by CNET, Judge William Griesbach rejected the request. Instead, he approved the ruling of a magistrate judge that the Fourth Amendment only protected the home and land directly outside of it (known as "curtilage"), not open fields far from any residence.

The Fourth Amendment protects "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." The court ruled that under applicable Supreme Court precedents, "open fields, as distinguished from curtilage, are not 'effects' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment."

Smuggler: One funny part of this claim by Mendoza an Magana was that they did not even own the property they were growing weed on. If others are growing weed in open fields what tech is there that can be used to detect cameras or other electronic devices in any given area?

TOPIC 4 - Plato

[Kim Dotcom me.ga Domain Drama](http://torrentfreak.com/me-ga-hackers-were-real-pirates-well-sell-dotcoms-domain-to-universal-121107/) and [new service details](http://torrentfreak.com/me-ga-hackers-were-real-pirates-well-sell-dotcoms-domain-to-universal-121107/)

TorrentFreak posts: A Gabon government minister has said that his country will not be used as a base for committing copyright infringement and has announced that his country will seize the new Me.Ga domain. But while Dotcom blames the United States and entertainment company Vivendi, a group of hackers say they have taken over the domain. Speaking with TorrentFreak the group say that they are the true pirates and that Dotcom is a megalomaniac.

Plato: Seems like Kim did this himself. One possibly setup the hacker group for media attention and full well knowingly chose .ga, knowing it was operated by Vivendi group. What are your thoughts on this, his new service details, and his plan to sue US Govt for 400 million and lay an trans ocean fiber cable to give everyone in NZ free internet?
