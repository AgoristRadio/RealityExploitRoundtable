End quote. The researchers flashed brief images of debit cards, pin numbers and
faces, and watched the output of the EEG headset for P300 peaks. Those are
spikes in neural activity that occurs when the brain recognizes a stimulus. With
this information, the researchers were able to guess the secrets about 20% more
reliably than randomly guessing.
