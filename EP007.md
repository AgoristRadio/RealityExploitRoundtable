# Is RER for me? clip


## Plato - [For Spain's Poor, Time is Money](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443404004577577352038273664.html)

Plato: Is this just a fad of people in crisis? Just another temporary 'disaster relief' community organization effort, or is this an actual global trend taking place where people are reassessing their relationships and activities in a collapsing welfare state world?

## wise-guy - [Obamaâ€™s Last, Desperate Attempt to Save Capitalism](http://c4ss.org/content/12252)

Roll RER007-package-obama-microfab.mp3

wise-guy: The additive manufacturing money recipients in this story are Defense contractors. Seems to me no different than the US government giving 40 million in funds to 20th Century Fox for the advancement of "The Arts". Or the treasury department giving a grant to the Bitcoin foundation. Seems like someone handing out grant money doesn't get it?

## smuggler - [Trackable Banknotes, at Last](http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/computing/embedded-systems/trackable-banknotes-at-last)

Roll RER007-package-trackable-cash.mp3

smuggler: To me this is essentially turning every bank note into a credit card like trackable bearer certificate. Combating drug trafficking is a sales meme by the inventors. If cash was trackable drug traffickers would not use it any more than they use credit cards. Aside from the fact that most drug money is moved via cashless systems like Fedwire anyway. They mentioned all the abuse they tested these notes with, but I did not hear mention of microwave tech. I think society as a whole at least system D and a large % of the world population will always want untrackable cash. What do you think?

## voodoo - [Florida Deputy Has Spidey Sense](http://www.theagitator.com/2012/08/26/florida-deputy-uses-spidey-sense-to-establish-probable-cause/) 

Roll RER007-package-spidey-cop.mp3 

voodoo: It's interesting, in many countries the police may try shit like this in order to extort a bribe out of the victim. It seems in the USA that it's more about a power game, the cops are already well paid, they are on a power trip, a hunt, to subdue and dominate. That thrill alone is worth it. As a matter of fact they would love you to offer them a bribe so they can just have another pretext to crack your skull. Whats to be done about this?
