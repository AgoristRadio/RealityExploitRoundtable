  Smuggler

The USG owns 500M shares in GM - 26% of the company. 
Obama purchased them for 16.5 billion dollars in 2010. Now they're worth 10.1 billion dollars. 
And Car And Driver reports that GM's 2012 Malibu is the worst among 6 new family sedans. 
In fact, it did even worse than GM's 2008 Malibu.

*Smuggler, is this the natural result of entrusting your government with your money? Are all governments this bad at business or just America?*
 
- [Predicting Location with Cell Phone Data](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/08/06/algorithm-aims-to-predict-crime-by-tracking-mobile-phones/)
  Voodoo

Researcher Mirco Musolesi says he can collate the information your cell phone leaks -

Of course, his first thought is to sell it to the NYPD Precrime Unit.

*Voodoo, is this hardware gonna be spying on us even if we pull our sim cards and use a meshnet?*
