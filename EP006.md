- [GM Bankruptcy?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiswoodhill/2012/08/15/general-motors-is-headed-for-bankruptcy-again/)
  Smuggler

The USG owns 500M shares in GM - 26% of the company. 
Obama purchased them for 16.5 billion dollars in 2010. Now they're worth 10.1 billion dollars. 
And [Car And Driver reports](http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2013-chevrolet-malibu-eco-vs-2012-honda-accord-ex-l-2012-hyundai-sonata-se-2012-kia-optima-ex-2012-toyota-camry-se-2012-volkswagen-passat-25-se-comparison-tests)
that GM's 2012 Malibu is the worst among 6 new family sedans. 
In fact, it did even worse than GM's 2008 Malibu.

*Smuggler, is this the natural result of entrusting your government with your money? Are all governments this bad at business or just America?*
 
- [Predicting Location with Cell Phone Data](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/08/06/algorithm-aims-to-predict-crime-by-tracking-mobile-phones/)
  Voodoo

Researcher Mirco Musolesi says he's made an algorithm that can predict where individuals will be
by collating information like gps data, telephone numbers, texts and calls.
Of course, his first thought is to sell it to the NYPD Precrime Unit.

> He used GPS data, telephone numbers and their texting and calling history to ...
predict [locations where] volunteers were heading to, [sometimes to] within 20 square meters.

> Crucially, the algorithm was only this precise when it also tracked the movements 
and data of each volunteer’s friends. When the algorithm was simply tracking the volunteer,
it could predict their future GPS coordinates to within roughly 1,000 square meters. 
When the prediction took into account additional information from a single friend, the 
error rate improved by several orders of magnitude.

*Voodoo, apparently our smartphones are all they need to spy on us. Are we screwed even if
we pull our sim cards and link our phones into a meshnet?*

*Wise-Guy, this Trapwire stuff is starting to overwhelm me. Obviously the complicated nature of the 
cybersecurity-industrial complex makes it hard to unravel. If we wanted to figure out how deep the 
rabbit hole goes, how the hell do we get the Truth without getting sidetracked by shills and bad info?*


- [Cartels Using Ultralights](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/ultralight/)

Wired reports that the government is escalating the war on drugs with $100 million worth of sensors 
that can detect ultralight aircraft. 

Luckily 
> One problem: there’s no telling how the Border Patrol plans to stop the planes once they detect them. The agency can’t 
legally shoot down ultralight planes just for carrying weed and blow.

Wired does the math - an ultralight might cost $3k, you can transport a few hundred thousand dollars 
worth of weed per run and ditch the plane. So,

> the cartels could make more money on marijuana flights in one year — just using ultralight aircraft — than the 
government will spend on its efforts to stop them.

Hiro, if you had a fleet of ultralights and 100 million dollars to spend, what would you do with it?
