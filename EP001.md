Cell phone surveillance  
=======================

Panelist: Plato  
intro clip: privacy tsunami http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qSuVkurJPw

Massachussetts Congressman Ed Markey (D),
co-chair of the Congressional Bi-partisan Privacy Caucus,
[sent out letters]
(http://markey.house.gov/content/letters-mobile-carriers-reagrding-use-cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement)
in May to US cell phone carriers requesting information on how often they 
comply with govt information requests.

The results are about as depressing as expected. Wired [sums up]
(http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/massive-phone-surveillance/):

* AT&T: Fulfilled **~260,000** requests in 2011  
* T-mobile: Won't say how many  
* Verizon: **~260,000**
* Sprint: **~825,000**  
  (broken down: 50k wiretaps, 75k 'trap and trace', 200k location, 500k basic info subpoenas)

Total ~1.3M plus an unknown number of National Security Letters

AT&T Vice President Timothy McCone says:

> the company employs more than 100 full-time staffers and “operates on a 24/7 basis for 
the purpose of meeting law enforcement demands.”

Sprint Senior Vice President for Government Affairs Vonya McCann says, in
a pdf where you can't select text:

> Sprint employs a team of 36 analysts who receive court orders for location and 
installation of wiretaps and pen register/trap and trace devices ... In addition to 
this group, Sprint employs approximately 175 additional analysts to respond to 
subpoenas and court orders for subscriber information that the company receives from
both civil litigants and law enforcement. All of these analysts are supported by 10 
managers and supervisors.

By Jimmy Wales' numbers, that's twice as many employees as the Wikimedia foundation employs. 
(he says '[around 100 staff](https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:FundraiserLandingPage)')

Bonus points! Bring up **IMSI catchers** - devices that handshake with GSM cell phones 
within range, able to listen in on calls and read text messages and get locations

Here's a handheld one I found via googling 'IMEI Catcher':

Google Execs take to the Washington Post to say Technology can be harnessed to fight the drug cartels in Mexico.
================================================================================================================

Panelist: Hiro

Intro: Washington Post Op-Ed http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/google-executives-say-technology-can-be-harnessed-to-fight-drug-cartels-in-mexico/2012/07/17/gJQACbXhrW_story.html

Peter Thiel vs. Eric Schmidt http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/thiel-v-schmidt.html

Google’s immense intelligence assets can be brought to bear on the cartels, Mr. Schmidt suggested.

via http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/googles-eric-schmidt-takes-tech-savvy-aim-at-mexico-drug-cartels/article4425759/

> Google’s ideas include creating a network so citizens can safely report cartel activity without fear of retribution. It wants to make sharing real-time intelligence easier among police in different regions. It can identify how individuals are connected to each other, to bank accounts and even to corrupt government officials. It can create community Web platforms for citizens to share information and name and shame criminals.

Wise-Guy's followup notes on
PROSTHETICS & Legal implications
--------------------------------

* are devices only property or are they parts of bodies?
* in October 2009 a Vietnam veteran's custom-made mobile-assistive device was damaged by 
an airline. The Vet was bedridden for 30 days as a result. The Airline initially only 
offered only a tiny settlement to repair the device but was later convinced by the Vet's 
lawyers to a much larger payout under the assumption that modern day prosthetics, which 
include implants, transplants, embedded devices like pacemakers, and wearable devices, 
are not inanimate, separate objects like a wheelchair.
* even while this tech is wearable it may be starting to change recognition
* when devices are implanted it may cause fundemental changes to definitions of what is or is not part of a
person's body and whether such augmentation is compatible with restrictions (privacy and safety) when applied to
external devices.
