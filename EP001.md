Cell phone surveillance  
=======================

Panelist: Plato  
intro clip: privacy tsunami http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qSuVkurJPw

Massachussetts Congressman Ed Markey (D),
co-chair of the Congressional Bi-partisan Privacy Caucus,
[sent out letters]
(http://markey.house.gov/content/letters-mobile-carriers-reagrding-use-cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement)
in May to US cell phone carriers requesting information on how often they 
comply with govt information requests.

The results are about as depressing as expected. Wired [sums up]
(http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/massive-phone-surveillance/):

* AT&T: Fulfilled **~260,000** requests in 2011  
* T-mobile: Won't say how many  
* Verizon: **~260,000**
* Sprint: **~825,000**  
  (broken down: 50k wiretaps, 75k 'trap and trace', 200k location, 500k basic info subpoenas)

Total ~1.3M plus an unknown number of National Security Letters

AT&T Vice President Timothy McCone says:

> the company employs more than 100 full-time staffers and “operates on a 24/7 basis for 
the purpose of meeting law enforcement demands.”

Sprint Senior Vice President for Government Affairs Vonya McCann says, in
a pdf where you can't select text:

> Sprint employs a team of 36 analysts who receive court orders for location and 
installation of wiretaps and pen register/trap and trace devices ... In addition to 
this group, Sprint employs approximately 175 additional analysts to respond to 
subpoenas and court orders for subscriber information that the company receives from
both civil litigants and law enforcement. All of these analysts are supported by 10 
managers and supervisors.

By Jimmy Wales' numbers, that's twice as many employees as the Wikimedia foundation employs. 
(he says '[around 100 staff](https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:FundraiserLandingPage)')

Bonus points! Bring up **IMEI catchers** - devices that handshake with all cell phones 
within range, able to listen in on calls and read text messages and get locations

Here's a handheld one I found via googling 'IMEI Catcher':
