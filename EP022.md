# Topic 1 - Wise-Guy

## FISA Court vs. the Department of Justice on NSA spying

It turns out that Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 found that the NSA’s surveillance under the FISA Amendments Act to be unconstitutional. Why doesn’t anyone know this? Because the decision was kept secret:

> "In a rare public filing in the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the Justice Department
> today urged continued secrecy for a 2011 FISC opinion that found the National Security Agency’s surveillance
> under the FISA Amendments Act to be unconstitutional. Significantly, the surveillance at issue [then] was carried
> out under the same controversial legal authority that underlies the NSA’s recently-revealed PRISM program."

It gets worse:

> "The government’s argument is guaranteed to make heads spin. DOJ earlier argued that it lacks discretion to
> release the FISC opinion without the FISC’s consent, but DOJ now argues that if the FISC were to agree with EFF,
> “the consequence would be that the Government could release the opinion or any portion of it in its discretion.”
> But FISC material is classified solely because the Executive Branch demands that it be, so release of the opinion
> has always been a matter of Executive discretion."

## IRS Goes Data Mining

> The Internal Revenue Service is collecting a lot more than taxes this year -- it's also acquiring a huge volume
> of personal information on taxpayers' digital activities, from eBay auctions to Facebook posts and, for the first
> time ever, credit card and e-payment transaction records, as it expands its search for tax cheats to places it's
> never gone before.

> The IRS, under heavy pressure to help Washington out of its budget quagmire by chasing down an estimated $300
> billion in revenue lost to evasions and errors each year, will start using "robo-audits" of tax forms and
> third-party data the IRS hopes will help close this so-called "tax gap." But the agency reveals little about how
> it will employ its vast, new network scanning powers.
