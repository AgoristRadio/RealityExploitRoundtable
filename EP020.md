## Mt. Gox / Dwolla / Liberty Reserve

Although Mt. Gox is run out of Japan, they used a US LLC to open a Dwolla account. That account has been seized by the
 DHS for acting as an unlicensed money transmitter.

The founder of Liberty Reserve has been arrested and assets seized as well as the domain names for independent sites
that acted as Liberty Reserve exchangers.

> In conjunction with Costa Rican authorities and Spanish police, U.S. law enforcement participated in a joint operation
> on Friday to arrest the founder of Liberty Reserve S. A., a private digital currency exchange service based in Costa Rica.
>
> U.S. authorities accused the currency exchange of facilitating $6 billion worth of money laundering, calling it a “bank
> of choice for the criminal underworld.”
>
> Since 2002, Liberty Reserve had been operating one of the oldest and most popular payment processors in the world with
> millions of clients. Vitalik Buterin of Bitcoin Magazine credits the company with being “one of the chief enablers of
> the Bitcoin economy’s early growth.” Payment methods such as credit cards and ACH transfers are not a great match for the
> irreversible bitcoin, because those payment methods can be reversed, or charged back. In 2010 and 2011 with the bitcoin
> exchanges struggling for irreversible inbound payment methods, Liberty Reserve Dollars and Liberty Reserve Euros were
> proprietary digital units that satisfied the need for payment finality.

## Money Laundering is Financial Thoughtcrime

Jon Matonis writes in American Banker:

> At its essence, money laundering is the act of concealing money or assets from the state to prevent its loss through
> taxation, judgment enforcement, or blatant confiscation. However, as the late J. Orlin Grabbe wrote: "Anyone who has
> studied the evolution of money-laundering statutes in the U.S. and elsewhere will realize that the 'crime' of money
> laundering boils down to a single, basic prohibited act: Doing something and not telling the government about it."
