Mindmeld is an iOS app expected to launch this fall that attempts to provide
context to human conversations. Ars Technica reports:

>MindMeld is ... an information-driven application which listens in to your
>conversation and attempts to understand what's being said. Once it figures out
>what you're talking about, MindMeld will try to create a model of the
>conversation's context, and from that it will attempt to locate and display
>relevant information from many different sources. 

Expect Labs founder Tim Tuttle at TechCrunch Disrupt, explaining MindMeld:

Plato, there are some really neat use cases for this technology and I think, in maturity, it will be a good tool to increase productivity. However, as a security consultant to Expect Labs, what risks would Plato Security Group warn them about?

- Social Media Use is Confusing  
-- [Army Says 'Social Network' Use Is a Sign of Radicalism](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/insider-threat/)  
-- [Facebook Convincing New Users FB and Internet are the Same](http://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/) 

According to Wired's Danger Room Blog, an assessment of a terrorism advisory organization inside the U.S. Army called the Asymmetric Warfare Group in 2011 listed some warning signs that a co-worker may be about to go postal.

Signs that you have turned into a terrorist who will soon kill your co-workers include recently changing your “choices in entertainment.” Having “peculiar discussions.” “Complaining about bias,” being “socially withdrawn” and frustrated with “mainstream ideologies.” Your “Risk Factors for Radicalization” include “Social Networks” and “Youth.”

Meanwhile, Facebook's plan to get its next billion users revolves around convincing current and potential users that Facebook IS the Internet, ala AOL.

In developing countries, Facebook applications are being packaged on SIM cards, text-only versions are available for feature phones, and, of course, Facebook mobile is available for smart phones.

Hiro, we've talked on the roundtable before about how not having social media accounts is suspicious to potential employers. Social media and widgets for social media seems like it's driving all development these days. So, the army assessment is completely at odds with what is going on in the world. Do you think it's a matter of the army panel being out of step, or do they really think that everybody is a potential terrorist?
