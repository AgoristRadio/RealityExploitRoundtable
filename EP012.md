- MindMeld
-- [Always on Siri](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/an-always-on-siri-mindmeld-listens-to-you-talk-finds-what-you-need)

Anticipatory Computing Engine is in ur head, predicting ur searches

Mindmeld is an iOS app expected to launch this fall that attempts to provide
context to human conversations. Ars Technica reports:

>MindMeld is ... an information-driven application which listens in to your
>conversation and attempts to understand what's being said. Once it figures out
>what you're talking about, MindMeld will try to create a model of the
>conversation's context, and from that it will attempt to locate and display
>relevant information from many different sources. "We're listening to the last
>ten minutes to predict what you need in the next ten seconds," [developer Tim]
>Tuttle told Ars.  "We're trying to make it so you never have to explicitly
>search for something you've already talked about."

> [While using the app,] it is constantly listening during a call so that it can
> hear everything and make sure it delivers the right information based on what
> you're talking about.

> MindMeld’s engine has been designed to do three things: it can decipher a
> multi-party conversation and pick out vital keywords from concurrent streams
> of dialogue in real time; it can do continuous, predictive modeling, which
> essentially means it listens to the conversation to understand what has
> already been said and what might be talked about next; and it can perform
> proactive information discovery based on what it's hearing so that it’s
> constantly finding and retrieving things for you.

OK hiro I thought about this for about 10 seconds and came up with this list of
shit that could go wrong:

* MindMeld servers archive your search history and build personal profiles
* Govt forces MindMeld to let them listen to your conversations
* iOS malware listens in on your conversations and gets handy links to your
  destinations, activities and friends
* MindMeld licenses this to govts and they install it in surveillance cameras
