Drone Economics

Although unmanned aerial vehicles are great for bombing weddings and double-tapping the first responders, government actors and the contractors pulling their strings are concerned that they're just too darn expensive. According to ARS Technica, General Dynamics has adapted an 81mm, gps-guided mortar to be used on smaller UAVs than the Predator, Reaper, or Global Hawk.

> In a series of three tests using a TigerShark drone—a 200-pound drone with a 
> 17-foot wingspan capable of taking off and landing on its own—the Air Drop Mortar
> (ADM) dropped the 10-pound test shells from about 7,000 feet. They fell within
> seven meters of the designated target in every test. The blast radius of a
> high-explosive 81-millimeter mortar shell is about 35 meters.

Meanwhile, in the United States, local warlords (or sheriffs as they are called) are purchasing UAVs as part of a general militarization against people who oppose their re-election campaigns. One warlord in Montgomery County, Texas has indicated interest in arming his UAVs.

Smuggler, in North America and Europe we're not yet to the point where government actors feel comfortable bombing unapproved bat mitzvehs and I think you have to go back to April 1992 to find an instance of a standoff in an open area of Texas. So, really, the only viable targets for armed UAVs would be individuals assembling at a time, place or manner of which the warlord does not approve. My questions to you are, who supports this kind of thing and do they really think this technology will not be turned against them at some point in the near future?

Milo Danger has built a six-rotor UAV and armed it with a paintball marker. In a YouTube video Danger demonstrates the effectiveness of this weapon system against human-shaped plywood cutouts.
