[Wired: anti drone fashions](http://www.wired.com/design/2013/01/anti-drone-camouflage-apparel/)
Smuggler, I read an article about rulescaping on Anarplex. As the eyes in the
sky breed, do you think we'll develop new social conventions to maintain our
privacy? There's plenty of locations where you cannot wear masks. Will there be
locations where it's taboo to show your face?

## Government to team up with Industry to fight Online Radicalization
[AlterNet: What Could Go Wrong? White House to Partner With Big Business to
Combat 'Online Radicalization'](http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/what-could-go-wrong-white-house-partner-big-business-combat-online-radicalization)

> Perhaps the most alarming aspect of the White House plan to counter “online
> radicalization” is it’s plan to work with “industry” to do so. “The Federal
> Government will collaborate with industry to explore how we might counter
> online violent extremism while protecting lawful Internet use and the civil
> liberties and privacy of individual users,” according to the White House.

Plato, what will be the consequences  if Verizon teams up with the Government to
fight terrorism?

[Scientific American: Why It’s Smart to Be Reckless on Wall Street](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/02/27/why-its-smart-to-be-reckless-on-wall-street/)

This article outlines a few strategies that traders use to get rich. The basic 
strategy is place big bets with company money. Worst case scenario you lose 
nothing.

Voodoo, in a well functioning market, the unfit traders are supposed to lose 
all their money so they drop out of the market. Apparently individual Wall Street 
traders can just profit with the firms' money. How on earth do the firms stay in 
business?
