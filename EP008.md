INTRO:

plato introduces panelists

(roll rapnews15.mp3)

Man I love those guys. Let's start with our first topic, covering the latest in
surveillance - microchipping the kids.

TOPIC 1 - VOODOO
-------

Kansas news station KSN reports that two schools in San Antonio, TX are
mandating RFID badges to track their students. As usual, they say it's for the
kids' own safety. 

(Clip: intro.rfid.wav)

**Voodoo**, if we didn't forcibly indoctrinate kids in our Prussian-style public
school system, they wouldn't respect authority. I was homeschooled and look at
me, now I'm an anarchist. Tracking kids like cattle is the obvious move for the
control freaks in charge of education who like the status quo. What should these
kids do to beat the system?

TOPIC 2 - SMUGGLER
-------

Our next topic is on hacking the human brain. Yossarian from #agora has more...

Thanks Yossarian. This attack has some scary implications. You may think that
you're just controlling your world of warcraft character with your mind, but
*actually* that malware you downloaded is in ur brainz, guessing your passwordz.

**Smuggler**, the CIA takes the brute force approach and uses MKULTRA techniques to
wipe out the minds of those with sensitive information. For us peaceful folk,
how can we defend against attacks on our minds?

TOPIC 3 - hiro? voodoo?
-------

The Honduran government has OK'd the construction of three [privately run
cities](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_HONDURAS_PRIVATE_CITIES?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-05-22-36-19)
in the hope that they can bring much-needed jobs and profit to the country.

> [The private cities] are the brainchild of Paul Romer, [a] New York University
> economist... Romer believes that importing sound laws and policies into small
> corners of badly run countries will help leaders reform their governments from
> the inside-out. [source
> fastcoexist.com](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680512/honduras-is-creating-privately-run-cities-to-combat-government-corruption-and-weakness)

Paul Romer runs [chartercities.org](http://chartercities.org), and was part of a
5-man 'Transparency Committee' charged by the Honduran governmant with building
the governments of these upcoming charter cities. Due to political bullshit, this
committee published an [open
letter](http://chartercities.org/blog/231/honduras-update) relinquishing their
role in the project.

> [So the Honduran] government has instead signed a deal with the MKG
> Group, a consortium of investors led by [Michael] Strong that intends to spend
> $15 million to begin building basic infrastructure on a city near Trujillo on
> the Caribbean coast.

Strong, a libertarian, is on the board of directors of the Seasteading group. He
[says](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_HONDURAS_PRIVATE_CITIES?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-05-22-36-19):

> "In general, free zones have been a spectacular success in terms of economic
> development... I'm very optimistic."

Here's some clips from Michael Strong's 2011 TED talk at TEDxUFM:

(roll michael.strong.clips.wav)

Guys, this sounds absolutely awesome. Strong sounds like an anti-authoritarian
who wants to make society more profitable. This is really going to be the first
real-life test of a society operating outside the umbrella of traditional
states. 

**Hiro/Voodoo**: Does Strong actually have a chance to compete against all the
crazy dictators with nukes who currently rule the world?
